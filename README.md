# torc Challenge
This is my solution for a Torc's challenge made in javascript.

In the index.js have all the logical handle the problem. In this file is defined a input that have all mocked data, and
the function responsable to calculate the receipt details.

## How to execute
You need to have installed NodeJs and be in the same folder (in terminal), and run: 

```
node index.js
```

## Test Plan
To execute the test file first you need to install globally Jest with: 

```
npm install -g jest
```
or
```
yarn global add jest
```

After that step you can run:

```
npm run test
```
or
```
yarn test
```
